# 🔍 Turnstile Debug Tool

The Turnstile debugging token didn't work for my project, so I created this small HTML tool to generate a real valid token for debugging a Worker project with Turnstile.  

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run:
```bash
   make start
```
2. Enter your **Turnstile Site Key** when prompted.  
3. Solve the CAPTCHA and check the **console logs** for the token.
